# Ray Tracing in OpenGL

This is an implementation of the path tracing algorithm using `C++` and `OPENGL`.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Generate your scene data in Blender, and output to `.obj` file format. Make sure to triangulate all surfaces. Drop your `.obj` file in the project directory.
3. Run `main.cpp` with your `.obj` file name as an argument.
